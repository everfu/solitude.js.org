## Modifying Theme Configuration

You need to modify the following configuration and customize it according to your needs.

```yml [_config.solitude.yml]
# # Approximately at line 926
# --------------------------- start ---------------------------
# Recent comments Page
# 最近评论页面
recent_comments:
  enable: true
  limit: 50 # ⚠️waline 仅支持最大50条评论 / ⚠️waline only supports a maximum of 50 comments
  cache: 0.2 # 1 = 1天 / 1 = 1 day
  page: /recentcomments/ # 最近评论页面 / recent comments page
# --------------------------- end ---------------------------
```

## Configuring the Page

Open a terminal in the root directory of your Hexo blog and run the following command to create a new page:

```bash
hexo new page recentcomment
```

## Creating the Data File

This will generate a `recentcomment` folder in the `source` directory of your blog, containing an `index.md` file.

Next, add the page `type` value inside this file.

Reference (modify as needed):
```md [index.md]
