## Install Hexo

If you haven't installed Hexo yet, please install it first. You can refer to the [Hexo official documentation](https://hexo.io/docs/index.html) for installation instructions.

## Install the Theme

::steps

### CD into the Project Directory

```bash
cd [project-name]
```

### Install the Theme

There are numerous ways to install the themeâ€”simply choose the method you prefer. If you find these instructions unclear, using the first method by default is recommended.

1. Install Using Git 

```bash
git clone -b dev https://github.com/everfu/hexo-theme-solitude.git themes/solitude
```

2. Manual Installation via Theme Files

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/everfu/hexo-theme-solitude/releases) version. Unzip it into the `themes` directory, then rename the extracted folder to `solitude`

## Copy Theme Configuration to Blog Root Directory (Optional)

To minimize inconvenience after theme upgrades, you can copy the contents of the `_config.yml` file from the theme directory to your blog's root directory and rename it to `_config.solitude.yml`.

#### NPM Installation

::code-group
```bash [Mac/Linux]
cp -rf ./node_modules/hexo-theme-solitude/_config.yml ./_config.solitude.yml
```
```bash [Windows]
copy .\node_modules\hexo-theme-solitude\_config.yml .\_config.solitude.yml
```
::

#### Git Installation

::code-group
```bash [Mac/Linux]
cp -rf ./themes/solitude/_config.yml ./_config.solitude.yml
```
```bash [Windows]
copy .\themes\solitude\_config.yml .\_config.solitude.yml
```
::

The configuration in `_config.solitude.yml` in your blog's root directory takes precedence over the `_config.yml` file in the theme directory. If you use `_config.solitude.yml`, corresponding configurations in the theme's `_config.yml` will not take effect.

When updating the theme, remember to check if the configuration file has changed. Release notes typically highlight changes or provide a diff comparison of configuration file versions. Simply synchronize these changes to your configuration file.

Note:
You are copying the theme's `_config.yml`, not Hexo's `_config.yml`.
Do not delete the `_config.yml` file in the theme directory.
